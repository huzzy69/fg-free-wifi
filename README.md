- **Enterprise Hardware**: Powered by high-speed, secure infrastructure managed by Fakhir Groups.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard for advertisers to track brand recall and ROI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with modern premium design principles
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Integration**: EmailJS for contact and advertiser inquiries
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Project Structure

- `src/pages`: Individual page components (Home, Advertisers, Locations, etc.)
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, Footer, Interactive Map)
- `src/context`: React Context for site-wide configuration

## How it Works

1. **Connection**: User selects "FG-Free-Wifi" at a partner venue.
